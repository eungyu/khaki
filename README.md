### Because real zookeepers wear khakis
A naive attempt at making an objective-c zookeeper client; 

Not fully implemented yet, but basic event loops and command execution flow is done. Just need to add each command to the library on top of this framework.


Now supports:
+ getData()
+ getChildren()
+ Watcher function registration and callback blocks
